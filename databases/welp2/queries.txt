1. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

- SELECT * FROM users, businesses, reviews WHERE businesses.id=reviews.business_id AND users.id=reviews.id;

1|John|Doe|1|McDonald's|1|4|Great customer service!|1|1
2|Frank|Smith|1|McDonald's|2|4|They're so nice!|1|2
3|Sally|Johnson|1|McDonald's|3|4|Great food!|1|3



2. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

-  SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.comment, reviews.stars FROM reviews
   JOIN businesses
   ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id
   JOIN users
   ON reviews.user_id = users.id;



John|Doe|McDonald's|Great customer service!|4
Frank|Smith|McDonald's|They're so nice!|4
Sally|Johnson|McDonald's|Great food!|4
Frank|Smith|Molly Maid|Terrible!!!|1


3. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

- SELECT * FROM reviews JOIN users ON reviews.user_id=users.id JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id=businesses.id WHERE businesses.id=1;

1|4|Great customer service!|1|1|1|John|Doe|1|McDonald's
2|4|They're so nice!|1|2|2|Frank|Smith|1|McDonald's
3|4|Great food!|1|3|3|Sally|Johnson|1|McDonald's
