I'll spend a few minutes orienting myself to the website and understanding exactly what jquery is before I delve in, since I'm hazy on it in general. If there are tutorials, I'll work on those. Otherwise, I'll use some of the sample code and play around with it, to see what it's used for and how it can be utilized. In addition to accessing the jQuery website, I'll look around the web and find what others have to say about using jQuery. Since I'm still getting the hang of JavaScript, I'll start with the goal of giving myself a basic understanding of how to do something small in jQuery, rather than overwhelming myself with trying to create something that is not yet within my scope of understanding.
