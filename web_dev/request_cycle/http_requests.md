Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?

Cookies are small files that are stored on a user’s computer when they visit a website. It helps the website recognize you when you come back, so that the experience is customized to you – such as remembering your username or password so that you don’t have to re-type it every time to visit a website.
