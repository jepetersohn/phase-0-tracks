In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

It is a private server hosted by a private company, in which users can store their websites or store their files by renting webspace from the company. Cloud servers are an example of a VPS. It provides privacy because no other webservers have access to your files, you can customize it, and they are cost effective.


Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

Because it could open your system up to attack by malicious software. If you’re not logged in as root, the malicious program wouldn’t be able to access everything.
