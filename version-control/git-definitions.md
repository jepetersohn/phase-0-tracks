* What is version control???  Why is it useful?

Version control lets you keep a history of the changes that you've made to a file so that you can refer back to them later. This is helpful in case something goes wrong with your code, you can go back in time to determine where it went wrong and hopefully remedy it.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a separate place where you can experiment with making changes to your code without affecting the master branch. This is useful because you don't want to mess up the master if you don't like the changes that you make.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
When you commit a change, is records your changes to the reposity. A good commit message should be short, but should offer a concise explanation of the changes that were made. 
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict can occur when two people working on the same reposity make changes to the same things. Git would have trouble determining while change to use, since they conflict with eachother.
